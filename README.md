Windows-Specific Usage:
Place this Python file in the same folder as your .heic images. Then, from a Windows Command Prompt opened at that folder, run the script (e.g. python script_name.py). It will:

    Create a subfolder called nueva_extension (if it doesn’t already exist).

    Convert every .heic file in the current directory into a .jpeg.

    Save each converted JPEG into nueva_extension\, preserving the original filename.

In short, it’s a bulk HEIC→JPEG converter designed to be run on Windows.
